# Personal-Health-Record-System

This System helps us to lead a better life & to make better choices in life.
By simlply reviewing our Medical History of each part of the body & can compare results of each year. We can understand it better when we know where it is heading to. We can understand better the areas we must improve. 

By simply using this system we can add areas we need to improve and more improtantly we can keep track of our improvements by simple performing small proative actions. we can feed those actions into this system as well, and can also check the improvements.

By simply using this system we can go back to our previous records to check what actions we had taken in the past, what had worked for us in the past for such problems, what contacts helped us the most, what minor changes had made the lot differene in past.
By simply using this system we can also keep track of our improvemnts regarding exercise we do. We can simply go back and check what worked for us in past & simply repeat them again. 

By simply using this system, you can get consistent reminders and notifications by email for the critical issues/data/records/improvements/problems/solutions. I am going to add this functionality very soon!
